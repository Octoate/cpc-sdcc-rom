cpc-sdcc-rom
============

This repository contains a Code::Blocks project for Amstrad CPC ROM development with the SDCC compiler.
It is a rather simple example on how to create a ROM for the Amstrad CPC and could be extended, but I 
hope it gives you a clue on how to create ROMs with a cross-compiler.

Currently this project works under Windows, because it uses a Windows "hex2bin" executeable, but you can
change this in the build settings of the project. You will find this settings under "Build Settings" in
the "Pre/post build steps" tab.

If you have any enhancement to this project: Don't hesitate to contact me via my website or send me a 
pull-request.
