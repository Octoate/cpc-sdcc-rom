cpc-sdcc-rom
============

This repository contains a Code::Blocks project for Amstrad CPC ROM development with the SDCC compiler
(http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/). It is a rather simple example on how to create a ROM for the Amstrad 
CPC and could be extended, but I hope it gives you a clue on how to create ROMs with a cross-compiler.

This project works under Linux and Windows. The files and Code::Blocks projects are nearly the same,
but under Linux the "Makefile", which was contributed by Duncan Bayne, is used within Code::Blocks
while under Windows the Code::Blocks IDE will be responsible for the compilation process.

If you have any enhancement to this project: Don't hesitate to contact me via GitHub, my website or send
me a pull-request.
